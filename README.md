# Uni Programming
This repository contains all the programming projects I do for university.

### How to browse
I divided it into all the periods I've come across so far, an then into the subjects I've learned in each period. You can find all the code I wrote for each subject, and soon I'll be adding READMEs explaining what they do.

### Disclaimer
As I study in a Brazilian university, the code contained in this repository is written in Portuguese (not the code itself, of course, but the names of variables, functions, classes, etc.), but I'll be adding explanatory READMEs as soon as possible ðŸ˜Š
